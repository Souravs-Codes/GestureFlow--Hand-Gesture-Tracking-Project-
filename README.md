# GestureFlow--Hand-Gesture-Tracking-Project-
GestureFlow is a real-time hand gesture interaction system built with Python and computer vision. It detects both hands, counts fingers from 1–10 using stable gesture logic, and enables gesture-based system controls with clean, intuitive visual feedback above each hand.
